# NPCTR Soil Organic Carbon Data Cleaning - Aarin Bothra
The repository includes original soil pedon and soil organic carbon stock data for the North Pacific Coastal Temperate Rainforest (NPCTR) and a combined, standardized dataset with data cleaning code from Aarin Bothra.

Goals:
  1. Clean and combine all raw data into a standardized, master dataset
  2. Recompute soil organic carbon stocks using raw data
  3. Add indicator columns to denote various gap-filling techniques used in the data
  5. Release the updated dataset to the Dryad repository

The paper describing the original data compilation and regional analysis is McNicol et al. (2019) [https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aaed52].

The original and updated dataset and soil organic carbon map are available via a Dryad data respository [https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.5jf6j1r].
